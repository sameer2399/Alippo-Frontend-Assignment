# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.



## Data Context

The `DataContext` in this code represents a robust state management solution for handling data in a React application. It leverages the power of the React context API, providing a centralized location for managing shared data and associated functionalities. This context encapsulates key features, such as data fetching, editing, and deletion, offering a comprehensive solution for maintaining a dynamic and responsive user interface.

The `DataProvider` component is instrumental in initializing and populating the data. It employs the Axios library to make asynchronous requests to an external source, in this case, fetching data from a JSON file hosted at `"https://assets.alippo.com/catalog/static/data.json."` Upon a successful response, the retrieved data is stored in the local state variable, and the loading state is set to `false`, indicating that the data is ready for consumption. Any errors encountered during the data-fetching process are gracefully handled, with corresponding messages logged to the console.

The `editData` and `deleteData` functions represent essential tools for dynamic data manipulation within the application. The `editData` function allows components to modify specific data entries by providing an index and the new data to replace the existing entry. Similarly, the `deleteData` function facilitates the removal of data entries based on their index. These functions work with immutable data practices, ensuring that modifications do not mutate the original state directly. Instead, a new array is created and assigned, promoting React's unidirectional data flow.

To enable widespread access to the data and functions throughout the application, the `DataContext` is consumed using the `useDataContext` hook. This hook simplifies the integration of the context into functional components, allowing for a clean and efficient way to access and update data. It also includes error-checking logic to ensure that the hook is used within the appropriate context, providing a degree of safety during development.

In essence, this `DataContext` offers a comprehensive solution for managing application-wide data, catering to common requirements such as fetching, editing, and deleting. Its design promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability, enhancing the overall structure and efficiency of React applications. Developers can seamlessly integrate this context into their components, benefiting from a streamlined and centralized approach to data management in their React projects.

## Working of Modal Component

The `Modal` component is designed to create a reusable modal window within a React application. It receives two optional props: `children` for any content to be displayed inside the modal and `open` to control its visibility. The default value for `open` is set to `false`. If `open` is `false`, the component returns `null`, rendering nothing.

When the `open` prop is `true`, the modal becomes visible, rendering a container div with a backdrop defined by the styles from the associated CSS module, `Modal.module.css`. The modal content, specified by the `children` prop, is wrapped in another div with its own styling.

This design allows for conditional rendering of the modal based on the value of the `open` prop. When the modal is open, it presents a styled overlay with the specified content.

The `Modal` component is used within the `TableAction` component to create a modal for editing or deleting data entries. The modal's appearance and behavior are controlled by the state variable `modal` within the `TableAction` component. This variable determines whether the modal is in an "Edit" or "Delete" state, and it triggers the corresponding content and functionality. The modal's appearance is further customized using styles from the `DataTable.module.css` file, providing a consistent and visually appealing user interface for data editing and deletion.

## Axios

`Overview:`
Axios is a JavaScript library commonly used for making HTTP requests in both browser and Node.js environments. It simplifies the process of interacting with APIs and fetching data from various sources.

`Installation:`
To use Axios in your project, you can install it using the following command:
npm install axios

`Key Features:`

Promise-based: Axios uses Promises, making it convenient for handling asynchronous operations.
HTTP Methods: Supports a variety of HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
Interceptors: Allows you to intercept requests or responses before they are handled by .then() or .catch().
Global Configurations: Provides options for setting global configurations such as headers, timeout, and more.


## Modular CSS

Modular CSS in React, facilitated by CSS Modules, enhances styling by encapsulating it within individual component modules. Each component receives its isolated styles, preventing global clashes. Styles are written in separate `.module.css` files, allowing for a component-specific approach. To utilize styles, import them directly into React components, treating them as JavaScript objects. This approach fosters a component-centric styling paradigm, improving code organization, readability, and maintenance. Components remain self-contained, promoting reusability and scalability as the application grows. Modular CSS simplifies styling complexities in React, offering a structured and efficient solution for building maintainable and modular user interfaces.
